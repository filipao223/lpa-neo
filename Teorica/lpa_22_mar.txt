Interval partition problem
-------------------------

->Set S={1,..,n}
->Each room can only be used by one event
->Each event i must occur in the interval [Si, fi)
->Select the minimum number of rooms to schedule all events

Function Partition(S)
    Sort events in non decreasing order by starting t=max =>  O(nlogn)
    R1 = R2 = ... = Rn = ∅
    d = 0
    for i ∈ S                                             =>  O(n²)
        if i can be assigned in some room Rk, k<=d
            R(k) = R(k) ∪ {i}
        else
            R(d+1)={i}                                   =>   O(nklogn)
            d++
    return d
